His sermons were published weekly and later compiled into 63 volumes, widely read throughout the English-speaking world and translated into many languages. The collection covers sermons preached at New Park Street Chapel and the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London, addressing a broad range of biblical texts and theological themes.
